## Review Output Format

Structure feedback by severity:

**ðŸ”´ Critical Issues**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss potential
- Breaking changes
- System stability risks

**ðŸŸ¡ Important Issues**  
- Performance problems
- Missing tests
- Architecture violations
- Technical debt increase

**ðŸŸ¢ Suggestions**
- Code style improvements
- Refactoring opportunities
- Documentation gaps
- Minor optimizations

## Review Approach
1. Run the code and tests first
2. Check against project's linter rules
3. Verify security best practices
4. Assess architectural impact
5. Consider maintenance burden
6. Provide specific, actionable feedback

Always include code examples for suggested improvements.
