# Current State Documentation

## Overview
The George Diab blog site has been redesigned with a minimal, dark theme inspired by zachholman.com. The site is built with Next.js 14 using the App Router, Tailwind CSS v4, and features a fully dark-themed interface.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Layout Architecture
- **Replaced SidebarLayout with MinimalLayout** (`/src/components/MinimalLayout.tsx`)
  - Clean, minimal header with site title and navigation
  - Footer with social media icons (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, GitHub)
  - Container-based layout inspired by Zach Holman's design
  - Dark theme throughout with `bg-[#0a0a0a]` background

### 2. Dark Theme Implementation
- **Global CSS** (`/src/app/globals.css`)
  - Comprehensive dark theme targeting all Next.js elements
  - Custom CSS classes for Zach Holman-inspired styling
  - Proper prose styles for blog content
  - Dark background (#0a0a0a) with light text (#f0f0f0)

### 3. Social Media Icons
- Located in MinimalLayout footer (lines 65-99)
- Currently using official SVG brand icons for:
  - Twitter/X (with hover color #1DA1F2)
  - LinkedIn (with hover color #0077B5)
  - GitHub (with hover color white)
- Icons are right-aligned with 1rem (gap-4) spacing between them
- Base color is gray (#888888) with brand-colored hover states

### 4. Homepage Design
- Posts organized by year with minimal styling
- Clean post listing with date and title
- Inspired by zachholman.com/posts layout

### 5. File Structure
```
/src/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx (uses MinimalLayout, dark theme styles)
│   ├── globals.css (comprehensive dark theme CSS)
│   ├── page.tsx (homepage with year-grouped posts)
│   └── blog/
│       └── page.tsx (blog listing with search)
└── components/
    ├── MinimalLayout.tsx (main layout component)
    ├── SidebarLayout.tsx (old layout, no longer used)
    └── Footer.tsx (old footer, integrated into MinimalLayout)
```

## Current Issues
- Design needs refinement to better match zachholman.com aesthetic
- Post preview cards on /blog page may need styling improvements
- Typography and spacing could be further optimized

## Next Steps
1. Continue refining the dark theme design
2. Improve post preview styling on the blog page
3. Optimize typography for better readability
4. Consider adding subtle animations and transitions

## Technical Notes
- Using Next.js 14 App Router
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom configuration
- Dark mode enforced through multiple layers (HTML, CSS, inline styles)
- Social icons use official brand SVG paths
- All components are properly typed with TypeScript
